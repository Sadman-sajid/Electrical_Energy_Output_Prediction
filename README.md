In this project, dataset of a combined cycle power plant is used to predict its output energy. The four independent variables were Temperature, Exhaust Vacuum, Ambient Pressure and Relative Humidity. 5 machine learning models based on 5 different algorithms were made to predict the output energy and the following was their accuracy result:
